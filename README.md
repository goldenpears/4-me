### About Game
`Wikipedia:` Connect Four gameplay where the first player begins by dropping his/her yellow disc into the center column of the game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with red discs, achieves four discs in a row, diagonally, and wins. If the game board fills before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.
